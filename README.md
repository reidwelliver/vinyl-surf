### Build Environment:

for now, you can try it by running 
```bash
./start -p example-component
```
from the root of the git directory. If you're running it from linux, you'll have to sudo, if you're running on OS X or Windows (both fairly untested by me so far) then don't sudo. I probably need to do some more work to get it to run OK with OS X/Windows/Docker Machine due to the way that they mount/copy host folders. Sam has reported that it works with docker-machine on OS X.

example-component has a cursory example structure. In-depth documentation coming soon.
